# Virtual-Lab-KVL

This project is aimed at developing a virtual lab environment where students can learn about 
the fundamentals of Kirchhoffâ€™s Voltage law (KVL) and understand how it works with the 
help of video simulation.

The virtual lab section of the application allows students to simulate KVL on different types 
of circuits such as simple circuits, series circuits, parallel circuits or a combination of both 
simple and parallel circuit.

The user can set the number of resistors or voltage sources they want to use in the circuit. 
The application creates a circuit accordingly and simulates the working of KVL and gives the 
output. This way the student can clearly analyze and understand how the system works.

Project was developed for CMRIT Virtual Lab.
